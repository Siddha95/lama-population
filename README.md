# lama-population
In this project I will count the population of Lamas.

Example: 
We have a population of 12 Lamas.
Each year, 12/3 lamas are born and 12/4 lamas pass away. 
How many years will take to have a population of 13?

This programm will promt the user some data and give back the total years necessary for the desired quantity of Lamas.
