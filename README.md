# lama-population
In this project I will count the population of llamas.

Example: 
We have a population of 12 llamas.
Each year, 12/3 llamas are born and 12/4 llamas pass away. 
How many years will take to have a population of 13?

This programm will promt the user some data and give back the total years necessary for the desired quantity of llamas. 


Steps:

-Promt the user for starting number of llamas.
-Promt the user for a goal number of llamas.
-Add and subtract lamas every year until we reach the desired quantity. (following the example's proportions)
-Print the number of years it took to reach the goal.
